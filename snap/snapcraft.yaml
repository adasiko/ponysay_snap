summary: cowsay reimplemention for ponies
description: |
  Ponysay displays an image of a My Little Pony pony saying a message provided 
  by the user in a terminal, or a quote from the show My Little Pony: 
  Friendship is Magic (MLP:FiM). 
  Historically ponysay was a wrapper for cowsay, but has since version 2.1 
  become an independent reimplementation of cowsay.
